# VS_XC32_CNC
A VS code independant build from xc32 compiler using gnu make.

This project is mainly to get the Makefiles compiling the source files in a folder structure unrelated to MPLAB X's folder structure
using GNU Make utility and the xc32 compiler install.

1: The xc32 path must be know and changed according to your install.

2: I have used the DFP and packs instlled by MPLAB X, make sure the paths are included in the Makefiles.
